# Inheritance-Square-Rectangle-
This C++ program demonstrates inheritance in object-oriented programming by defining a base class Shape that represents both rectangles and squares.\
Key Features:\
•	The Shape class contains two attributes: width and length.\
•	It provides methods area() and perimeter() to calculate the area and perimeter of the shape.\
•	The Square class is derived from Shape and ensures that both sides are equal upon initialization.\
•	The main() function creates a Shape object (rectangle) and a Square object, then prints their area and perimeter.\
This implementation follows best practices by avoiding redundant attributes, ensuring proper inheritance, and maintaining clean, readable code.
